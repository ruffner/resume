	abstract = { View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-1576.vid The Kentucky Re-entry Universal Payload System (KRUPS) is a small re-entry capsule designed as a technology testbed. For its first incarnation, KRUPS has been designed to test Thermal Protection System (TPS) material and instrumentation. TPS are used to protect spacecraft, and its payload, from the extreme conditions of planetary entry. KRUPS has been developed at the University of Kentucky over the past 6 years. The current project is aimed to produce system verification, software implementation, and launch qualifications, using an atmospheric balloon platform. The capsule was designed to transmit data using the Iridium satellite network. Recovery of the capsule was planned, using a parachute that aimed at preventing a crash landing and thus protecting the internal components. Thermal measurements of the TPS were received by the capsule as it returned to Earth. This satisfied the main objective of the flight. It verified that the capsule was successfully activated, ejected, and that the data was transmitted. However, the capsule did not have a successful parachute deployment, due to a timing issue. Therefore, the capsule was not able to be recovered in one piece. }

	abstract = { View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-3129.vid The Kentucky Re-entry Universal Payload System (KRUPS) team at the University of Kentucky is planning a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) in which three capsules will be sent up into orbit on board the NG-16 Cygnus resupply vehicle. After orbit on the ISS, the NG-16 payload will be de-orbited which will cause the three capsules to re-enter the atmosphere. Each capsule will be outfitted with a heat shield which will block heat from entering the internal capsule. The goal of the mission is to collect thermal data measured by thermocouples placed at the surface of each heat shield. Several tests were conducted to verify the capsules as a whole functioned properly. Additional tests were conducted to ensure various subsystems installed in the capsules functioned properly. The tests were successful and the capsules were qualified to be launched on NG-16 to the ISS. }

abstract = {Structured light illumination is an active three-dimensional scanning technique that uses a projector and camera pair to project and capture a series of stripe patterns; however, with a single camera and single projector, structured light scanning has issues associated with scan occlusions, multi-path, and weak signal reflections. To address these issues, this paper proposes dual-projector scanning using a range of projector/camera arrangements. Unlike previous attempts at dual-projector scanning, the proposed scanner drives both light engines simultaneously, using temporal-frequency multiplexing to computationally decouple the projected patterns. Besides presenting the details of how such a system is built, we also present experimental results demonstrating how multiple projectors can be used to (1) minimize occlusions; (2) achieve higher signal-to-noise ratios having twice a single projector's brightness; (3) reduce the number of component video frames required for a scan; and (4) detect multi-path interference.},
